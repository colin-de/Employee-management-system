## Management system requirements

Employee management system can be used to manage all the information of employees in the company

This tutorial mainly uses C++ to implement a polymorphic-based employee management system


The employees in the company are divided into three categories: ordinary employees, managers, and bosses. When displaying information, we need to display the employee number, employee name, employee position, and responsibilities

Duties of ordinary employees: complete the tasks given by the manager

Manager's duties: complete the tasks given by the boss, and issue the tasks to the employees

Duties of the boss: manage all company affairs

The functions to be realized in the management system are as follows.

* Exit management program: Exit the current management system

- Add employee information: realize the function of adding employees in batches and entering the information into the file, the employee information is: employee number, name and department number
- Display employee information: Display information of all employees in the company
- Deleting employees: Deleting the specified employees according to their numbers
- Modify employee information: Modify employee's personal information by number
- Find employee information: search for relevant employee information by employee number or employee name
- Sort by number: Sort by employee number, with user-specified sorting rules
- Empty all documents: Empty all employee information recorded in the file (need to confirm again before emptying to prevent accidental deletion)
